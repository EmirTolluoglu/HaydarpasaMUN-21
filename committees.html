                <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>International Labour Organization (ILO) was established by United Nations
                in 1946. The principles of social justice have been established on the basis of the protection of
                universal human and labour rights. The ILO expresses international labour standarts through
                conventions and recommendations. These conventions and recommendations set minimum standart on
                fundamental labour rights; the right to organize, collective bargaining, the elimination of forced
                labor, equality of opportunity and other issues related to working life. It also provides technical
                assistance in areas such as vocational training and vocational rehabilitation, labour policy, labour
                management, labour law and industrial relations, working conditions, business developments,
                cooperatives, social security, labour staticts, occupational health and safety. It encourages the
                development of independent employers and employees organizations and provides training and
                consultancy services to these organizations. Within the United Nations, the ILO forms a tripartite
                strong relations with equal participation of employees, employers and governments. As the academic
                team, we suggest this committee to beginner delegates. So would you like to take big steps for
                humanity? Come and join us!

                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The United Nations as part of the 2030 Agenda, adopted the Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDG’s) to take urgent actions in order to make the world a better place by 20
                    Years. The Goals aim to end poverty and hunger while promoting economic growth and address social
                    issues like education, health, equality and unemployment as well as tackling climate change. The
                    United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development took place during 20- 22 of June 2012 in Rio de
                    Janeiro. It produced political strategies for implementing Sustainable Development. In the
                    Conference member states agreed to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals in accordance with the
                    Millennium Development Goals. The member states also agreed to establish a process in the General
                    Assembly to prepare options for sustainable development financing. The political outcome document
                    formed the basis of the SDG’s and programs to implement these. In HaydarpaşaMUN'20 it is time for
                    another summit of the Sustainable Development Conference in which the states will debate on
                    encouraging multi stakeholder partnerships and voluntary commitments on sustainable development
                    financing and supporting sustainable development in small island states.

            officially commenced in 1995 in order to regulate international trade between nations. Now with the
            session which will be held on HaydarpaşaMUN’20; a crucial topic, concerning not only the European
            Union but the whole world will be discussed. Ever since this topic started being discussed upon in
            1970's; European Council, arranged several meetings to talk about it. However in this session we're
            enlarging the perspective expanding it to whole world. Now we're giving the stage to the World Trade
            Organization to let them make their points regarding negative and positive effects of Brexit to the
            international trade. And our second agenda item is the Doha Development Agenda. The political
            outcome document formed the basis of WTO policies. The Debate and further negotiations covered many
            areas but reports show that tourism, being most LDC'S main source of income, lacked in mention. In
            HaydarpaşaMUN'20 WTO will discuss The Importance of Tourism in the implementation of The Doha
            Development Agenda.

            (UNESCO) is an organization that works to establish peace by the means of international cooperation
            in Education, Science, and Culture. It was established on the 16th of November 1945 after the
            participating countries in a conference decided to found an organization that would encourage a
            culture of peace, secure an "intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind," and prevent another
            world war. After the conference concluded on November 16th of that year, 37 of the member states
            formally founded UNESCO with the Constitution of UNESCO the current programs of UNESCO contribute to
            the completion of the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in Agenda 2030, which was affirmed by
            the UN General Assembly in 2015. In doing so, it uses its five main programs: education, natural
            sciences, social/human sciences, culture and communication/information to sponsor projects in fields
            such as but not limited to literacy, teacher-training, and heritage conservation. By doing so, it
            makes an important benefaction to the preservation of global cultural diversity and promoting
            progress worldwide in education. In the 4th edition of HaydarpaşaMUN, the topics of Effects of
            Global Warming on World Heritage Sites and the Global Implementation of STEM will be tackled by the
            delegates. The delegates will be spending the four days of the conference to debate upon and find
            the appropriate solutions to these issues at HaydarpaşaMUN. Come and join us in the UNESCO committee
            for sessions full of fruitful debates and lots of fun!

            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>United Nations Security Council is one of the six principals of the UN. It
            was established after World War 2 and held its first session on 17 January 1946. It has 15 members,
            5 of them being the permanent members, those remaining 10 non-permanent members are elected on a
            regional basis to serve for two years. Security Council is responsible for investigating the
            aggressive actions which can harm the international peace and security. It can even put sanctions
            and use force to maintain peace. Apart from protecting security and peace, Security Council
            recommends to the General Assembly the appointment of the Secretary-General and together with the
            assembly, they elect the judges of the International Court Of Justice. In HaydarpaşaMUN'20,
            delegates will be dealing with an ongoing issue: Sinai Insurgency. Sinai was known for its
            lawlessness and after Hosni Mubarak resigned from his position right after the Arab Spring, there
            was no one to observe the area. This helped local Bedouin groups to be armed and encouraged them to
            dispute the authority of the government. Will you be able to bring peace to the Sinai Peninsula and
            stop the conflict between Islamist militants and Egyptian Security Forces?

        <p>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Joint Crisis Committees are very different from other traditional MUN
            committees. They are not official UN bodies and they don’t have a specific format. They also don’t have
            formal debates over resolutions. The delegates will be debating upon contemporary crisis and taking
            actions towards them. These committees are very thrilling, each with very interesting and controversial
            topics either historical, futuristic or fantastic. JCC’s consist of two or more cabinets, each in
            different rooms trying to defeat one another. Everything that is made within the cabinets stay
            confidential unless they are not public. These committees don’t require a resolution paper in the end
            but they always proceed with directives or press releases. JCC’s are probably the hardest committees
            since they require the delegates to be solution focused and farsighted, they must see the further
            actions and their consequences and must be ready for them. Therefore, these committees require a lot of
            responsibility too. On the other hand, what makes these committees so entertaining is that it gives you
            the opportunity to directly act towards a current action and having a word in history and future.
            Delegates can go as creative as they want to go since there are no boundaries. You can literally lead an
            army and change the destiny of the committee. This year in HaydarpaşaMUN’20, JCC will take place between
            1639 and 1651. The topic will be “Wars of the Three Kingdoms” which was a series of bloody wars took
            place in the kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland. These years of war have shaped the politics of
            Great Britain, indirectly the whole Europe. In this year’s JCC, the delegates will have the chance to
            take place in three kingdoms mentioned above and they will have the chance to reconstruct the history
            and therefore change today’s statuses. We can assure you that, you’ll have a great crisis experience
            with the help of our experienced and hardworking crisis team. Advanced delegates who want to change the
            destiny of Great Britain are more than welcome in JCC in HaydarpaşaMUN’20! If you believe in yourself
            upon becoming the consultant of this mastermind, changing the history for forever and writing directives
            which will make your name memorialized now you can make sure that you have found the right committee for

            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Advisory Panel is a consultative and neutral body, which seeks to make
            recommendations on how to solve a specific issue or how to improve the solutions which have already
            been implemented and provide detailed guidance to a corporation or an organization from an unbiased
            perspective . Since the Panel is an advisory organ, it is non-binding and it has no authority to
            force an action or impose penalties. The Panel consists of experts of countries’ stance and
            involvement in the issue from various countries or organizations, who are unbiased and innovative.
            Both the debate and the voting will occur clause by clause and the Panel will require consensus in
            order to pass a clause. This year in HaydarpaşaMUN’20, the Panel will take us back to 1973’s oil
            crisis. The crisis began when the members of OPEC (​Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
            Countries)​ imposed an embargo on countries which supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, also
            known as the Arab-Israeli War. The embargo started against the US in retaliation for the US decision
            to supply the Israeli military during the war. But soon later, the OPEC members also expended the
            embargo to other countries that supported Israel such as the Netherlands, Canada, Portugal and the
            UK. Over the next six months, oil prices quadrupled. Prices remained at higher levels even after the
            embargo ended. The crisis caused many long and short term effects on global economy and politics,
            some of which still affect the global economy today. If you’re interested in going back in history
            and change the destiny, the Advisory Panel is waiting for you...

            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>International Court of Justice is the primary judical organ of the United Nations
            which was established in 1945 by the United Nations Charter. Placed in the Peace Palace in Netherlands,
            Hague ICJ settles the international disputes between member states by acting as both an advisory opinion to
            UN organs and as an arbitrator of the disputes which are submitted by member states. ICJ also known as The
            Court, acts in accordance with the international law accompanied by 15 elected judges. These judges evaluate
            the pieces of evidence and the witnesses related to the case following the very own procedure of ICJ.
